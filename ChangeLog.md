New Senate Communications API endpoints were released. The Senate Communications API consists of a list level and an item level. Data elements are similar to the existing House Communications API.

Detailed information about each Senate Communication is available at the item level. The new endpoints are available at https://api.congress.gov/v3/senate-communication.
